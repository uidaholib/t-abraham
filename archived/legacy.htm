<p>
The inadequacies of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCHS)
to manuscript and archival cataloging have a long and distinguished
history. The National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections
(NUCMC), an organizational unit of the Library of Congress, initially
used LCHS in its first attempt at a nationwide catalog of manuscript
collections. In the 1962 volume, they declared LCHS inadequate
for their uses. Terms, they said, &quot;have been compiled without
regard to any established list of subject headings and without
any comprehensive precedent for indexing manuscript material.&quot;
(NUCMC 1959-1962 Index, p. iii) Here we have the surprising vision
of Library of Congress catalogers rejecting the Library of Congress
list of subject headings. Even so, Walter Rundell reported, in
his <i>In Pursuit of American History</i>, that researchers complained
about the &quot;inadequacy of [NUCMC's] library headings or tracings&quot;
as late as 1970. (p. 239)
<p>
Other complaints surfaced as well. Recently, on the Archives Listserv,
a Canadian archivist noted a particular frustration, the lack
of adequate LCHS terms for the literature of archival science.
&quot;For example,&quot; he noted, &quot;there is no subject heading
in LCHS for the archival function of appraisal.&quot; (2 May 1995)
This certainly overlooks the decided lack of books devoted to
archival appraisal, all of which could be counted on the tines
of a fork.
<p>
And Marcus Robbins, of the City of Portland Archives, asked in
the same forum whether it was time to scrap subject access in
a system that provides full-text searching. Specifically, &quot;should
we scrap subject access in favor of local keyword, personal name,
geographic location, and organization? Should we also shift emphasis
to form, genre, and activity of creation? Our current authority
file is way too broad and imprecise. In the past, catalogers have
misused subject terms, making such searches inaccurate and unusable.&quot;
(20 April 1995)
<p>
Even among librarians, primary users and consumers of LCHS, the
number of critics of LCHS ranks high. A browse through <i>Library
Literature</i> over the past three decades will give quite a feel
for the depth of criticism and, as well, its lack of effectiveness.
<p>
In response to changing technology, more than user complaints,
NUCMC eventually returned to using LCHS. &quot;Beginning with
1985, in preparation for the <i>National Union Catalog of Manuscript
Collections</i> becoming part of an automated national database,
the decision was made to conform to the Library of Congress Subject
Headings whenever possible.&quot; (NUCMC 1985 Index, p. vii)
<p>
Yet, this did not resolve the questions of subject access, either
to books or manuscripts and archives. A recent analysis of subject
searching on on-line public access catalogs (known as OPACS, many
of which keep track of the kinds and numbers of searches) demonstrates
that while subject searches predominate, LCHS searches are quite
a small minority. Out of 10 million searches on one system in
1994, less than six per cent were LCHS searches. &quot;One important
thing we have learned from tracking OPAC use over the last 10-15
years is that subject phrase searching (i.e., searching on Library
of Congress Headings) is not frequent, popular, or often successful.
In OPACS where this is the only kind of subject searching supported,
it is not used as frequently as title searching.&quot; (Charles
Hildreth, PACS-L, 3 April 1995)
<p>
These criticisisms, complaints, and lists of inadequacies, do
not mean that archives (or libraries) should abandon LCHS. Even
modifications of LCHS terms to meet perceived needs on local systems
are merely exchanging one set of problems for another. The <i>Art
and Architecture Thesaurus</i> is an example of a local term list
that, through massive grant funding, has become a recognized part
of the cataloging process. This is not an avenue to be taken lightly.
In addition, in a world-wide environment, local variations tend
to get lost in the larger schemes of things. At the least, they
serve to confuse users who must learn new terms at every research
stop.
<p>
In recent months the news media has become conscious, in its overexcited
way, of something it refers to as &quot;legacy software.&quot;
This is software, now decades old, but still in use, which is
now causing problems. The best example is the millions of dollars
planned to be spent over the next five years to ensure that large
national databases and control programs are aware that the year
after 1999 is 2000 and not 1000 or 1900. This is the result of
hard coding dates as the last two digits of the year, i.e. '94
or '95. The programs will add one to '99 and be quite happy with
'00 but we might find our social security benefits, for example,
off by a thousand years.
<p>
There is a lot of legacy code in the world, from software, to
miles and gallons instead of meters and liters, to the odd jog
in the road at the boundary of a 1913 residential subdivision.
The Library of Congress list of Subject headings (even though
greatly revised in the last several years) is just that kind of
legacy code.
<p>
Legacy code is what we are stuck with and, often, what we choose
to live with because it is too much trouble or too expensive to
change. Critics of LCHS have offered alternatives for decades,
but we have only revisions, not a wholesale overhaul.
<p>
On solution to the legacy code problem is to leave it as it is
and bypass it. And today we see glimmers of what will bypass,
but not replace, LCHS access to manuscript and archival collections.
<p>
Many repositories, including the University of Idaho, have succeeded
in getting manuscript and archival material cataloged and added
to the library's (and the regional or national) database. These
MARC-AMC records make full use of the capabilities of LCHS for
subject access as well as provide various other forms of key-word
searching.
<p>
But the new development, less than six months old in our shop,
is to load entire inventories to the institutional web-server.
This adds the document to possible WAIS search results (or will
in the future) and permits full-text searching of the inventory
once it is opened in the browser.
<p>
An effort is underway to standardizing the coding for inventories
to facilitate these kinds of searches. This is one of the goals
of the Berkeley Finding Aid Project, which is attempting to identify
an encoding standard for electronic finding aids. The standard
will be in a Standard Generalized Markup Language Document Type
Definition (SGML DTD). &quot;Researchers at the University of
California, Berkeley will develop the encoding standard in collaboration
with leading experts in collection processing, collection cataloging,
text encoding, system design, network communications, authority
control, text retrieval, text navigation, and computer imaging.
Project participants will analyze the structure and function of
representative finding aids. The basic elements occurring in finding
aids will be isolated and their logical interrelationships defined.
The DTD will then be developed based on the results of this analysis.&quot;
(Pitti, Daniel. Sharing the Wealth: Toward a Finding Aid Encoding
Standard. 1995.)
<p>
The result of this project, if widely adopted, will be to turn
our legacies into our heritage. Legacies are a form of inheritance
in that they are personal and singular. LCHS, and the MARC format,
will continue to have a use in providing brief abstracts of groups
of records for researchers. They serve, in this way, as a guide
to the inventories. Recent developments in adding hyper-text links
to MARC fields has demonstrated that it is possible to provide
immediate jumps from the descriptive abstract to the more comprehensive
inventory. 
<p>
Access to the inventory is the key to making use of the heritage
information archivists have compiled about documents. A heritage
is a community based foundation for the future. Heritage provides
the continuity of the past for the present to build upon. Access
to inventories on the World-Wide Web servers increased the ability
of researchers to identify what they need, who has it, and how
big is it. Loading existing and future word-processed inventories
into HTML and posting them on the Web is just the first step of
this process. The next step is to link them to the MARC records.
This heritage of descriptive inventories will become the building
blocks of a descriptive program that will increase the availability
of our collections world-wide. <hr>
