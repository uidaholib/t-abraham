Dinosaur joke: Two dinosaurs are opening fortune cookies. &quot;Funny,&quot;
one says, &quot;mine doesn't say anything either.&quot;
<p>
Unlike the dinosaurs, archivists and manuscript curators at all
institutions are aware that their world is changing, that there
is a tidal wave of documentary materials headed their way. Materials
unlike all others they have yet dealt with. Materials that exist
only as the slightly ordered fragments of magnetism on an iron
substrate. Materials that can only be read or viewed through special
lenses, lenses that distort even as they display. These are records
in electronic format and we have been preparing for their arrival
as assiduously as the 1952 school boards ignored the impending
onslaught of baby boom first graders.
<p>
While there are those who have worked with magnetic media archives
for years, most of us are so awash in huge backlogs of traditional
paper records and documentation that we are only just now sticking
our heads up and looking around and noticing the oncoming tsunami.
<p>
Fortunately, some people are thinking and theorizing about electronic
records, watching for patterns and erecting signposts. Fortunately,
as Terry Cook pointed out in <i>Archivaria</i>, it will &quot;be
easier...to join the electronic records race the second time around
than it was initially.&quot;<a href="#One">[1]</a>
<p>
The principal difference between electronic records and conventional
records is that the medium is now completely independent of the
message. A letter is no longer a piece of paper that may have
been folded, placed into an envelope, and sent through the mail.
We can now peel the words off the piece of paper, send it across
the ether, reconstitute it on a screen or spray it onto another
piece of paper. Some electronic records exist only as &quot;virtual
documents,&quot; never existing as real documents. The report
is generated to the screen once upon request; by the time of the
next request the information has been changed. One example that
we might be familiar with is the library circulation system that
reports on the status of different books in the system. The information
is dynamic and constantly changing.
<p>
Another example might be an e-mail system that maintained transmission
and receipt logs behind the scenes. In this case, and many others,
as one archivist noted, &quot;the systems used to create these
records are themselves part of the record.&quot;<a href="#Two">[2]</a>
<p>
Nonetheless, many of our concerns about the document or group
of documents are the same as they have ever been. What is the
provenance of the record, how do we provide access to it, how
do we describe it, how do we preserve and store it, how do we
present it to the user?
<p>
We are in a transition between the old and the new. ARCHIVES listserv
subscribers last year read the complaints of a faculty member
whose decade's worth of 8&quot; Displaywrite diskettes were refused
by a university archives because they were unable to read or properly
store them. Here is an example for those of you who missed this
era. [Hold up 8&quot; diskette.]
<p>
Last year the Legislature of the State of Idaho passed a law allowing
taxidermists and fur buyers to keep records on media other than
paper.<a href="#Three">[3]</a> Within recent memory, the contents
of White House hard disks were being argued in the courts. When
we look at all the data that is accessible on the Internet we
wonder who, if anyone, should have the responsibility for preserving
it. Although first a joke, it is now accepted that all newsgroup
postings, even those to USENET groups such as ALT.STARTREK.GET.A.LIFE,
are potentially being archived and may come back to haunt the
intemperate poster.<a href="#Four">[4]</a> The LISTSERV software,
such as that used by the Archives &amp; Archivists List, does
have automatic archiving and searching capabilities and this message
base is being used as a resource by students.
<p>
Last February, we again had a wide-ranging and interminable discussion
of these changes on the ARCHIVES listserv. The original inquiry
was whether &quot;to accept e-mail and WordPerfect files created
on the campus network by a retiring faculty member.&quot;<a href="#Five">[5]</a>
In sorting out the responses to this question we see that they
fall into three camps.
<p>
First, was the question of whether such electronic records were
archival records. A function of this appraisal process was the
institutional mission. It was quickly suggested that if the disks
contained information that fit one's collecting responsibilities,
then they should be acquired and retained.
<p>
The second class of responses dealt with physical maintenance
of these records. At one end we had the simple (and to some, too
simple) admonition to print them all out to paper because the
technology (hardware and software) is changing so rapidly. At
the other end were discussions of the permanence of optical disks
and magnetic impulses. In addition, it was noted that electronic
records are also dependent on the software used to create them
and view them; over time that software may change or become unavailable.
Therefore, data migration would involve the move to both a newer
hardware platform and newer software. For instance, can you still
convert Displaywrite data on eight inch disks to MSWord data on
3 1/2 inch disks without losing any of the formatting?
<p>
The third class of response was to urge archivists to grasp this
opportunity to shape the technology to achieve archival ends.
&quot;Archivists,&quot; said one, &quot;need to be involved in
the decisions that are being made in many companies and schools
regarding choices for new computer technologies and computer systems.&quot;<a href="#Six">[6]</a>
Some college and university archivists mentioned their service
on campus task forces that have been set up to design new system-wide
automation resources.
<p>
Throughout this discussion there was a disturbing subtext. Archivists,
it was often assumed, are solely responsible for the retention
and preservation of records. The archival profession, as it has
necessarily increased its level of professionalism, has begun
to assert that it not only knows best about what is or is not
archival, but that it makes these decisions in a societal vacuum.
In reality, archivists and manuscript curators operate in a field
where everything that they do is dependent upon others.<a href="#Seven">[7]</a>
Archivists may help determine records schedules, for instance,
but it is the individual department's clerical staff who may,
or may not, remember to follow the schedule when filing, sorting,
or disposing of records. The Maine State Archives recently reported
such a case. An agency director called the archives asking for
the use of a shredder for some confidential records. In anticipating
the shredding, and to save the state money, she had had her staff
remove all the manila folders. The state archives now has the
job of trying to reconstitute the files from boxes full of loose
papers. There was, we were assured, a retention schedule in place,
but it was inconveniently forgotten.<a href="#Eight">[8]</a>
<p>
In addition, the determination of what to save has been formulated
in an environment independent of the needs of users; in fact,
we bemoan the lack of user studies in our discipline but make
little attempt to initiate such studies. Can we demonstrate that
those records we designate as archival are the minimum necessary
to answer all research questions? According to one eminent historian,
Archivists are the wrong people to determine if something is historically
important, as reported in a recent article in the <i>New Yorker</i>.<a href="#Nine">[9]</a>
<p>
On the supply side of the equation, we should recognize that our
support funds are dependent on what has been termed &quot;resource
allocators,&quot; that is, those who hand out the money. This
may be a dean or director, a finance officer, or a remote vice-president.
A study of their attitudes concluded that archivists were considered
to be doing important work, but not so important as to take a
great deal of their time, attention, or budget. In much the same
way, the discussion about electronic records in archives misses
an essential point: we can not solve this problem alone. Even
service on a campus computing task force is not going to solve
all one's archival problems with electronic records.
<p>
Rob Spindler of Arizona State has made this point when he wrote
on the LISTSERV: &quot;the software dependent environments that
are most likely to be made upgradable are probably those in which
our society's largest information investments are made. In other
words, business and government have made substantial investments
in certain technologies -- I would argue that those investments
are most likely to be protected by insuring that this information
can be upgraded to newer systems.&quot;<a href="#Ten">[10]</a>
<p>
Our concerns about preservation of electronic records, data migration,
and software and hardware capability will all be solved ... if
the larger society agrees with us that these issues and the records
are important.
<p>
In the meantime, I think we do have some slight grounds for optimism.
I think there are solutions to the problems of electronic records
and I expect the technology to provide us with those solutions.
I base this on three principles: first, the Second Law of Thermodynamics
suggests that order is but a small part of a larger world of disorder.
I have written at some length about this before, but in summary,
systems tend towards disorder. Thus, it takes an expenditure of
energy to maintain a semblance of order under this pressure.<a href="#Eleven">[11]</a>
Arrayed against the downward spiral of informational disorder
is a relatively small band of archivists and concerned citizens
anxious for the record to be retained and willing to make the
necessary energy expenditure.
<p>
Second, like governments, society gets the archives it deserves.
There will always be a relatively low level of support for archival
functions. They are just not that important to most people. For
example, just one casino chain in the United States rakes in over
nine billion dollars every year. I would estimate that the total
expenditure on archives in the States is less than two percent
of that.<a href="#Twelve">[12]</a> Casino gambling is obviously
much more important to society than are archives. Matching expectations
with resources will continue to be extremely difficult. Thus archivists
are not going to be able to solve the problems of electronic records
by throwing more archivists at them. We must concentrate on working
smarter.
<p>
Third, the newly emerging field of study labeled complexity theory
offers the liberating idea that self-organization is inevitable
in large systems.<a href="#Thirteen">[13]</a> Feedback systems,
first developed to control steam engines in the early days of
the Industrial Revolution, are recognized as one example of the
self-organizational aspects of complex natural systems. Archivists
documenting organizations must rely on the members of these to
set aside and preserve the vital records necessary for permanent
documentation. And they will do it for us if we make it easy for
them. Records management is really just a subset of people management,
and thus more difficult than we give it credit for.
<p>
In the meantime, while we wait for new tools to help us select,
describe and make available electronic records, what resources
are available to us now? Here are my &quot;interim&quot; suggestions;
hard and fast rules they are not, subject as they are to rapidly
changing technologies.
<p>
First, one solution is to put it on paper and treat it as any
other documentary record. Better yet, let the agency staff put
it on paper and file it. According to Cyndi Merritt, an archivist
with the State of Washington, their policy on e-mail messages
is to schedule them into three classes, only part of which are
considered permanent records.<a href="#Fourteen">[14]</a> Of those
designated permanent, paper copies are to be created and filed.
No electronic copies are maintained. While I believe this is a
common practice, comparable to notes on telephone conversations,
not all agree that it is sufficient. In the federal court ruling
regarding the White House PROFS files, Judge Richey found that
&quot;the printing of the records onto hard copy does not satisfy
the requirements of the Federal Records Act since it does not
show who received the information and when they received it.&quot;<a href="#Fifteen">[15]</a>
<p>
I am less in favor of this as a solution than I was previously.
Software systems to manage electronic records are increasingly
becoming integral to the record. In addition, it is clear that
the impact of electronic messages is different from messages on
paper. The intemperate postings on the ARCHIVES listserv are but
one example of this common phenomenon. Any reformatting of the
message then should only be undertaken as an extreme measure to
preserve the content, much as society has expended millions of
dollars microfilming newspapers.
<p>
I am coming toward expecting a technological answer to this problem.
The many arguments for maintaining the electronic format suggest
to us that -- whether it is optical disks or magnetic regeneration,
which is the systematic copying of old files to new tapes or disks
-- some long-term solutions are close at hand. In the meantime,
I too have ten-year-old floppies that so far still seem readable.
<p>
Second, encourage the use of document management techniques already
built into the system now being used. Disks can be labeled internally
and externally. Hard disks can be subdivided into archival materials
and temporary files. Major word-processing software includes document
summaries that keep track of the document version, its date of
creation and revision, and allow searches to be made on the document's
title, author, operator, key words and comments. If a comment
field includes the term &quot;Archival,&quot; or some other codeword,
then it is an easy matter to use the searching mechanisms that
permit copying or deleting selected files. These will become even
more important as offices migrate to networked PCs and abandon
the limitations of stand-alone units. As Fred Stielow has pointed
out on the LISTSERV, there are software and hardware combinations
that &quot;have transparent and automatic controls that reduce
[archival] decision making and save energy.&quot;<a href="#Sixteen">[16]</a>
Such &quot;recordkeeping systems&quot; are just beginning to be
addressed in the archiva l literature.<a href="#Seventeen">[17]</a>
<p>
Third, if the cost of memory and storage continues to decline
as it has been, &quot;archiving&quot; electronic records will
rely more on software searching attributes and less on physical
storage capabilities. This also indicates that access will be
more a function of the searching tools and less of the order of
one piece of paper next to another. Physical location, here in
Ottawa, or on a server in Idaho, will also be meaningless. While
a lot of less-than-archival junk will be retained, it will probably
not be any more than is kept in paper-based systems. But the effort
to organize and retrieve material should be reduced by automated
methods. Newly developed tools, Gopher, Archie, Veronica, and
World-Wide-Web, are the beginnings of a transformation of the
electronic frontier. There are products available today under
the term &quot;electronic document management technologies&quot;
that offer &quot;document imaging; archival/retrieval to an optical
disk jukebox; O[ptical] C[haracter] R[ecognition]; natural language
text search with fuzzy-search-by-word, fuzzy-search-by-concept,
and query by meaning; annotations; forms overlay/dropout; and
fax input/output ...; and variable scanner and printer support.&quot;<a href="#Eighteen">[18]</a>
And, while I have only a fuzzy idea of what these terms represent,
I can tell you what it means; it means that cyberspace is increasingly
where archivists, like the rest of the information society, will
be living full-time. And if we do not accept and embrace this
role, we will have reached a dead end. We will be like the two
dinosaurs in the cartoon; they are out walking and notice many
other dinosaurs, feet up, dead. One says to the other: &quot;Oh-oh,
I don't like the looks of this.&quot;
