<h1>
Practical Processing: Arrangement and Description</h1>
<p>Terry Abraham
<hr width="100%">
<p>In part prompted by the exigencies of temporary duty in Washington,
D.C. in 1987/88, I thought I would pull together something from my experiences
working with manuscripts and archives and put it down on paper (actually,
on computer). In looking at it these many years later, it is very rough
in places but possibly worth sharing nonetheless. Notably missing, understandably,
is any mention of the World-Wide Web and its transformation of the public
face of archives. There are undoubtedly other gaps as well.
