<h1>Why Special Collections? 
</h1>
<p>
Terry Abraham<br>
November 14, 1989<hr>

<p>
During orientation sessions to students I introduce Special Collections
with something like this:
<p>
&quot;Special Collections includes books, manuscripts, archives,
historical photographs, maps, ephemera and other primary source
materials. Primary source materials are those which provide first-hand
documentation of past events. These research materials are frequently
unique or otherwise rare, either singularly or in the aggregate,
and thus: Special.&quot;
<p>
Here is an example: Quintus Curtius Rufus' life of Alexander the
Great printed in Milan in 1481; a prime example of that class
of books called incunabula -- a Latinate expression for the cradle
of printing, meaning it was published within 50 years of the invention
of the printing press. Its rarity is well documented; not only
is it but one of a dozen copies in the United States, but between
1916 and 1965 only one was offered for sale at auction. As an
artifact, an object of art, this book is over 500 years old; but
aside from some waterstains and bookworms, it wears its age well.
Compare the quality of the paper and inking, black on white, with
more recent books. It is easy to see why some believe that the
art of printing has never equaled the books of the fifteenth century.
So, this is a very special book and its very existence speaks
&quot;volumes&quot; to us about the nature of Special Collections.
<p>
It is as primary sources that Special Collections materials are
revered. While much library research requires only secondary sources,
such as books and articles in the general collection, it is important
that some of the secondary sources be based on research in primary
materials. Without that basis, without that touchstone of source
documentation, research becomes the building of imaginary air-castles.
Even worse, it becomes self-referential and introspective, with
little or no connection to the &quot;real&quot; world.
<p>
In recent years, literary criticism has -- to many onlookers --
become private and subjective, solely an interior dialogue between
critic and text. While nuances and insights have sometimes resulted
from such studies, there is a growing tendency to class them with
such pseudo-research as psycho-history and creationism. What is
seen as the misuse and abuse of primary sources are among the
major criticisms of these kinds of studies.
<p>
J. D. Salinger, among all modern authors, through active enforcement
of his literary copyright in the courts, has shifted inquiry from
his person to his texts. In this way, he maintains control over
the world's perception of his antecedents, influences, and associates;
all legitimate areas of scholarly inquiry. His overwhelming desire
for privacy, which I do not deny him, again illustrates the importance
of primary source materials for the study of literature and other
fields in the humanities.
<p>
The importance of primary sources -- as such -- are amazingly
overlooked by the public at large and -- as well -- by many in
the scholarly community. Even as librarians have been frequently
shunted aside by the academic community, archivists and special
collections curators receive scant regard for their efforts. It
is common for a researcher to loudly proclaim to reporters the
happy discovery of materials &quot;lost&quot; in archives or libraries;
materials that have been consistently described in institutional,
regional, and national bibliographies and finding aids. If the
high point of your professional career is the inclusion of your
name in an acknowledgements page, after family, colleagues, and
pets, then you are on the right elevator, the one going down.
<p>
Equally as disturbing are those scholars who do not seem able
to connect their activities, once the article is published, with
the larger world of scholarship. I once approached a noted scholar
of modern Europe seeking the donation of his papers. I was amazed
that he seemed unconcerned about their preservation and future
use even as he tantalized me with descriptions of letters, memos,
photographs and memorabilia of royalty and heads of state which
he had gathered for his own research.
<p>
While I have my own theories about scholarly neglect, I would
have thought that the fact that the Watergate, Iran-Contra, HUD,
and other governmental scandals hinged to a large extent on primary
sources including government archives might have prompted a greater
appreciation for their importance among the general public. Beyond
each specific case, however, they seem unable to extrapolate from
those instances to the general principles of the importance of
maintaining and preserving governmental and other records.
<p>
In my role as defacto University Archivist I often receive calls
from office secretaries -- frequently denoted Secretary-slash-Records
Manager at our institution -- &quot;We have these old files that
we were going to throw away and thought you might want to look
through them before we do so.&quot; (In Idaho, as in so many other
states, it is illegal to discard governmental office files without
appropriate authorization.)
<p>
One of the goals of the Bicentennial of the Constitution was to
again demonstrate to the citizenry of the republic the revolutionary
impact of our written constitution -- unlike Britain's ancient
but unwritten code. This country was founded and maintained --
up until recently -- on the basis of documents and documentary
evidence. All of this, somehow, hasn't made much of an impression
-- particularly now that we have tossed books, magazines, and
newspapers aside for sound-bites on the TV.
<p>
The point here is that Special Collections, as repositories of
primary source material, have a major role to play in the preservation
and transmission of knowledge. Preservation, in the broadest sense,
is perhaps the most visible activity of Special Collections. Special
reading rooms, special facilities, special cataloging, special
precautions, special rules; all are outward manifestations of
the importance, the primacy, of ensuring the survival of unique
and/or rare materials.
<p>
About one hundred years before Antony Zarotus printed Curtius'
Alexander, the fictional abbot in Umberto Eco's <i>Name of the
Rose</i> noted: &quot;...a book is a fragile creature, it suffers
the wear of time, it fears rodents, the elements, clumsy hands.
If for hundred and a hundred years everyone had been able freely
to handle our codices, the majority of them would no longer exist.
So the librarian protects them not only against mankind but also
against nature, and devotes his life to this war with the forces
of oblivion, the enemy of truth.&quot; (1983, p. 38)
<p>
Frequently hidden from view is the role of the Special Collections
in the transmission of knowledge. The principal form of this activity
is in the description of the collections. Special Collections
have experienced -- along with the rest of the library world --
a revolution in this area. First books, and now manuscripts and
archives, are accessible through regional and national databases.
In my own professional career, the first guide I compiled to a
manuscript collection was composed on a typewriter and retyped
and retyped until each page was nearly perfect. Later, specific
inventories were prepared on the mainframe using clumsy text-handling
software. Less than a decade ago, low-cost database and word-processing
software on a PC as began to ease inventory and guide preparation.
I can remember showing my first built-from-a-kit computer to the
processors as they worked on hard-wired terminals. This year,
I am directing a grant-funded project that will move data from
the PC back to the mainframe in the MARC format and upload it
to the Western Library Network for inclusion in the CD-ROM version
of their bibliographic database.
<p>
Increased access to the holdings of Special Collections will mean
increased use; for too long we have -- like Eco's medieval librarian
-- guarded our treasures from all but the most persistent users.
During the year I served as program officer at the National Endowment
for the Humanities I gained a greater appreciation for the breadth
and richness of Special Collections in our nation's libraries.
The program I helped administer, the Access Category in the Reference
Materials Section in the Research Division, was designed to aid
scholarly research in the humanities by supporting increased access
to primary source materials. Each year, the program supported
between twenty and thirty projects to the tune of approximately
$2.5 million. These included archival guides and inventories,
subject bibliographies, and major database projects at both large
and small repositories.
<p>
It seems, however, that just as the holdings of Special Collections
are being included in the electronic catalogs as integral elements
of the library's holdings, libraries in general -- and academic
libraries in particular -- are rethinking their role as book repositories.
Increased methods of access, improved techniques of data transmission,
and higher costs of library materials have propelled some to suggest
that libraries should stop being providers of book objects-like
and concentrate on being information providers.
<p>
The &quot;electronic library,&quot; defined as an institution
&quot;without walls and without circulating books&quot; is touted
by some futurists in the library field as the solution to all
our budgetary and professional needs. William Arms, Vice-President
for Academic Services at Carnegie Mellon, recently predicted cheaper
storage on computer than in libraries within ten years. (<i>Newsletter
on Serials Pricing</i> <i>Issues</i>, n.7, p.4) The resulting
transformation of libraries will be monumental; but I can do some
predicting too. In my crystal ball I see: First, the electronic
library will be an incremental event; the transformation of institutions
will depend on their mission and their finances (thus the change
will take much longer than ten years). Second, Special Collections
repositories will never become totally independent of collections
of books and primary sources. And third, the word library will
eventually come to mean Special Collections.
<p>
It is ironic that just as Special Collections are entering the
mainstream of the library world, that stream is being channeled
in a direction away from the central focus of Special Collections.
Again, I point to Quintus Curtius as an example. This artifact
-- with its studs and clasps -- is as much evidence of its time
as the text it contains. Renaissance scholarship, coupled with
the increased availability of books, revived classical texts,
among them this frequently reprinted life of Alexander, a cautionary
tale of martial imperialism. To bind the book in wood with protective
bosses reveals both something of the dangers books were exposed
to as well as some of the attitudes toward textual learning. Was
it perhaps a textbook for a Milanese knight or politician? Primary
sources in Special Collections, books or manuscripts, are often
as important for their context or container as for their content.
This volume, we must remember, was produced when printed books
were as new, as innovative, and as culture-changing as the VCR
is today.
<p>
The idea that the artifact is an essential part of the documentation,
a part that is diminished and lost if abstracted, digitized and
faxed is a tough one to get across to some. A culture which has
been led to believe that an egg mcmuffin is a reasonable substitute
for eggs and toast or that a colorized version of Casablanca is
a legitimate motion picture experience will have some trouble
recognizing the virtue of &quot;real&quot; books and original
source materials.
<p>
Special Collections have long been seen as &quot;museums&quot;
of the book; dusty books, dusty shelves, dusty librarians, archivists
and curators. The adjective &quot;dusty&quot; denotes lack of
use. Number of users, however, is an imperfect measurement. Alex
Haley, author of <i>Roots</i>, was one archives user. His book,
however, sold in the hundreds of thousands. The TV mini-series
based on the book was seen by millions. Which number best captures
the total use of primary sources?
<p>
Another aspect of the transmission of knowledge by Special Collections
are public programs, receptions, lectures, exhibits, and publications.
These are a natural outcome of the interaction with the special
materials in Special Collections. Friends of the Library groups
are frequently drawn to support the library as a whole through
an interest in the special materials in Special Collections. And,
I have noticed that important scholarly resources frequently gravitate
towards those repositories with significant and publicly known
collections. News can be defined as the non-routine and thus Special
Collections -- of all parts of the library -- is the most frequently
newsworthy.
<p>
In conclusion, I recall that twenty years ago when I was student
in the library school at the University of Oregon I took a class
in library automation. Large rooms full of humming cabinets were
the norm it seemed; our textbook, I recall, was full of flow charts
and pictures of key-punch machines. I contrast that with the recent
report I received via BITNET from a library school student in
Maryland whose automation class is studying interactive CD-ROMs,
hypertext, expert systems, artificial intelligence programs, and
-- of course -- electronic mail. It would be easy for Special
Collections librarians to turn their back on our rapidly changing
world and return two decades or so to the cloistered existence
they had so long known and fostered; but it would be a denial
of their responsibility to the collections. For much as we must
work to insure survival of the objects, we must also foster their
use. And, as you might be able to tell, I believe that use of
Special Collections is the most special thing about them.<hr>
