<p>Most archivists, it seems, started their careers as processors; frequently
processors who were forced to learn on he job. "Here," they were told,
"read this, then arrange and describe these 200 boxes. If you have any
questions, look me up."
<p>The two hundred boxes rise in immense piles or glower dustily from the
shelves. So, where to start? The first step, it seems is to take the boxes
off the shelves and look inside. After a while it makes sense to take some
notes about the contents of each box; this requires some temporary numbers
taped to the front of each one, perhaps with some indication of the contents.
That is, if it was possible to determine what the contents were; are those
letters or correspondence? Are these ledgers day books or journals? Is
a scrapbook one item or 250 items? Is that an invoice or a voucher?
<p>But what order shall the boxes take; these "A" files obviously go before
the "T" files in that box, but what about the phonograph records? I know
original order is supposed to be important, but this is chaos.
<p>And once ordered, how best to describe it. Can't very well describe
each postcard and letter although some are kind of interesting, but that
would take years. How about if we just list the original folder headings?
Okay, but what about "Henry's car" or the folder labeled "Cranks!"? Is
this the right way to do this?

<hr width="100%"><p>Each processor is faced with a multitude of decisions
at each step along the way. Archivists and manuscript curators have devised
rules of thumb to aid in the decision making process; but at the foundation,
only archival theory provides guidelines for decision making.
<p>The core of archival theory has three parts; these affect arrangement
more so than any other archival activity. In fact, almost no other aspect
of archives has any sort of theory to support it. This may be an indication
of the importance of arrangement in the world of archives.
<p>The triumvirate of archival theory are: Provenance, Respect des Fonds,
and the Sanctity of the Original Order. Provenance and Respect des Fonds
are descended, as might be guessed from the nomenclature, from events of
the French Revolution. The transfer of control from the aristocracy and
the clergy to the people, and the resultant claims of property rights and
other records of ownership, dumped a great mass of confiscated records
onto the public archivists. To aid in keeping track of both the lineage
of the records and their impact in litigation, the French archivists developed
the principle of Provenance which states that the circumstances of a record's
creation are an integral part of its evidentiary value and must not be
destroyed or concealed.
<p>From this followed the principle of Respect des Fonds as it was noted
that it was easiest to keep exact track of where a record originated and
how it was used if it was not relocated by reason of its content. Accordingly,
subject was not an appropriate reason to refile a record. If an individual
or organization created a record, then that item was forever a part of
that person or organization's records. This also was applied to sub-bureaucracies;
the records of the Department of Health were always to be considered separate
from the records of the Department of State.
<p>The final principle, Sanctity of the Original Order, flows quite naturally
from the first two. It was somewhat of a later accretion and so it comes
down to us in English. Perhaps a result of the rise of German historicism,
where documentary evidence (and the resulting footnotes) became the acme
of scholarship, original order addresses the evidentiary relationship between
one piece of paper and succeeding pieces of paper in a Fonds (or group
of records). The historian was becoming aware of the value of context:
a letter filed next to a draft of a reply, next to the reply and the response
adjacent to that reply told a little story about the event that had more
meaning than just the exchange of pieces of paper. Once taken out of that
context, each individual piece of paper becomes orphaned, with no sense
of its own past.
<p>Aside from the theory of it, are there practical reasons to follow the
rule of Provenance? The most practical reason of all, is that those trained
in historical research (which is not to say most historians) rely on the
evidence of the records to reveal both facts and nuances of the historical
past. If a historian of the war-time exploits of the seventh Earl of Doncaster
was to find himself in an attic in Leicester with a trunk containing the
late Earl's correspondence and the evidence indicated clearly that the
trunk had not been touched since the Earl placed it there some forty years
previously, certain conclusions regarding the evidentiary value of the
material objects in the trunk would present themselves. For instance, all
pencil annotations on the letters are contemporaneous with the letters
(or at least prior to the closing up of the trunk). The order of the letters
is that in which the Earl placed them at the time they were received or
as he arranged them before placing them in the trunk. Barring clues that
someone else had been into the trunk and had disrupted the Earl's original
order, the historian would make some assumptions about the trunk's contents,
even before reading any of the letters.
<p>Suppose, however, that the Earl's least favorite nephew, having inherited
the trunk and not wanting to be bothered with it, placed it on the auction
block to realize additional funds for, let us say, the appreciation of
the competitive nature of equine mobility (i.e., the horse races). An American
university, as was all too common, purchased the trunk and its contents
and dragged it off (amid cries of those concerned with the export of a
nation's cultural heritage) and dumped it on the manuscript curator's desk.
At this point, the nephew had been all through the trunk, the dealer who
had advised the nephew to place it at auction had been through the trunk
(and had acquired a few nice autographs in payment) and the auction house
cataloger had looked at every item at least twice. Seeking to restore the
original order, the manuscript curator neatly organizes the contents into
a chronological sequence. The historian, thinking better late than never,
arrives and reviews his evidence. The words in the letters haven't changed,
of course, but the more intangible clues of propinquity and adjacency are
now forever lost. And worse, if the historian assumes -- or is flatly told
by the manuscript curator -- that what is in view is "the original order"
then it is not hard to foresee the fanciful history that will be constructed.
<p>What this means is that it is just as important to identify -- where
possible -- purposeful changes to the order of a body of paper as it is
to try to reconstruct that original order. And, that reconstruction may
be just as much a fantasy as any Roman bronze with a Greek head grafted
on it.
<p>Clearly it is important to understand the role of Provenance and Original
Order on historical evidence, but -- far more practically -- is the assumption
that it is more efficient (as well as more valid as historical evidence)
to use the original order. The assumption is that if there was any order
at all, it was created by the originator because it eased retrieval; this
is true even if the order is solely chronological by date of receipt, which
is perhaps the most common order in the world. If this "original order,"
no matter how simple or complex, was useful to the originator or the office
of origin, then it should be equally as useful to those who follow if the
nature of the order can be explained. If it is useful at all, then it is
certainly more cost-effective to maintain that order than to create, from
scratch, a new and different order which is "theoretically" easier to use.
<p>On all these grounds, then, the importance of the original order is
supported as a theoretical principle: it carries the burden of historical
evidence, it is cost effective to maintain an existing order rather than
create a new one, and, finally, if it was at all useful for the original
user of the file then it should still be useful to subsequent users. There
is in fact, a kind of organic unity to these arguments.
<p>These three principals (for full definitions see the SAA glossary) then
became the rock of theory around which the river of processing flows. Like
most dogma, however, they are frequently sacrificed on the altar of expediency.
Be that as it may, let us take a closer look at the normal flow of processing.
<p>The first step in processing any group of records is to look into its
Provenance: how did it get to the repository, where did it come from, who
was the creator, what was their job or position, what was the activity
being recorded? The primary place to look for this information is in the
accession register.
<p>The accession register (for more information on accessioning see the
relevant SAA handbook) serves two purposes: it records the provenance of
the accession and it records its disposition within the repository. The
first lists the donor or office of origin, any biographical or organizational
details, which will place the records in context. Secondly, it will record
transactional data about the accession (when it was received, how big was
it, what kinds of restrictions have been imposed) and where it has been
stored.
<p>With that information, the processor can bring all the boxes together
in one place to begin processing. Following the guidelines of archival
theory -- and acquiring something like the status of theory itself -- we
should note Oliver Wendell Holmes' (not the Supreme court Justice, by the
way) exposition on the five levels of archival arrangement. He noted that
different kinds of arrangement activities take place at the different hierarchical
levels of the repository. For instance, the separation of fonds one from
another means that they shall be physically separate; and thus arranged
in different places on the shelves. A record group or manuscript collection
would be an entity which would have a separate shelf location. Series would
also be differentiated and not intermixed. The folders and items within
them would be arranged differently depending on the order of the materials.
Each of these levels would have a different conceptual organization.
<p>To start at the top of the heap, so to speak, at the repository level;
there is one principal concern: that archival records and manuscript records
not be intermixed. Even here, at this point we must consider the impact
of description. Does it make a difference to the researcher or to the archival
theorist if archival records and manuscript groups are intermixed on the
shelves, as long as they are adequately distinguished in the catalog? Some
university archives stretch the boundaries of Respect des Fonds by treating
faculty and alumni records as archival records; not authorized to collect
manuscripts, they rationalize the inclusion of non-archival records into
an archival repository by declaring them to be, at the very minimum, archivally-related.
<p>Generally speaking, arrangement at the repository level speaks only to
the split between archives and manuscripts. Some institutions shelve them
separately but administer them under one roof; others have established
separate administrative and physical facilities and ensure that the twain
shall never meet. For a medium to small institution, it is probably more
cost-effective to administer archives and manuscripts together (one reading
room, one catalog, one reference desk) and merely shelve the two in separate
locations. However, as noted above, if the descriptive apparatus is adequate,
there is really no need to shelve them apart.
<p>The difference is that between bibliographic and physical control. Arrangement
is concerned with physical control, while description is concerned with
bibliographic control. It is an axiom of archival processing that one can
maintain the original physical order and yet attain better bibliographic
access by rearranging the records, so-to-speak, on paper. Indexes are a
common method of providing a rearrangement of information which does not
disturb the physical arrangement. It is easy to see that there is a tremendous
inter-relationship between arrangement and description, at all levels of
control. Archivists, tend, however, to treat them as separate and independent
activities.
<p>At the record group or collection level, it is usually easy to see the
physical boundaries. This collection starts here and ends there. But what
of a body of records which is received in ten-year increments; are they
to be shelved all together or are they to be shelved separately and described
as one unit; or, should they be both shelved separately and described separately.
A thirty-year accumulation would then be in three separate locations and
have three separate descriptions in the file. Is this efficient or inefficient?
<p>Archivists, particularly archivists of the old school, sometimes make
noises about the classification of record series. Once upon a time, in
some sort of borrowing from library classification systems, archivists
felt that a hierarchical classification which represented the organizational
hierarchy was an effective way to arrange record series. The classic example
of the implementation of this idea and a full-scale retreat from it occurred
at the National Archives in the 1940's. Finding a hierarchical system unworkable,
particularly in the face of ongoing and massive changes in governmental
agencies and operations, the Archives created the Record Group concept.
Basically, this would apply an arbitrary number to a series of records
grouped around a major administrative unit, such as the Department of Agriculture.
The benefits of this system are still not perfectly described, but it did
have one, unlooked for, benefit: it separated the numerical arrangement
from the organization hierarchy. It doesn't make any difference if Agriculture
is RG 1 and Transportation is RG 2 or vice versa. The numbers are just
for convenience in labeling.
<p>So, if you discard the whole concept of maintaining an arrangement that
reflects the organization, you realize that if the description makes the
hierarchy clear, all the arrangement needs is a location number. Each series,
or each record group, or each manuscript collection can just be numbered
sequentially so they can be put on the shelf quickly. In fact, different
accessions from the same office can be filed under different location numbers;
after all, it is the descriptive system which lets the researcher know
that the two groups are connected in some fashion and it doesn't really
matter that they are from the same office at different times, or from subordinate
offices at the same time. Once they've been numbered, it is possible to
find the box on the shelf.
<p>Series offer the same sort of complexities; how are they to be defined;
what are the boundaries between them? It is easy to identify the contents
of a box, or a folder but how do you arrange them. Or, more to the point,
how do you maintain the original order in their arrangement?
<p>Let us go back to the 200 boxes piled on the floor to see if we can
resolve some of these difficulties. A search of the accession records reveals
that while this group was received as a unit, a prior (and much smaller)
accession from the same family had never been processed. These records
are then recovered, although still kept separate, and added to the larger
whole. A quick pass to survey the records reveals that they are all of
a unit: they deal with the activities (multiple though they may be) of
one family. Accordingly, this is determined at the first level of arrangement
to be one collection.
<p>The next step is to identify, temporarily, the major series and sub-series.
There are a multitude of definitions of series, but the one I find most
useful is that "If it looks like a series, it must be a series." This kind
of certainty is only acquired after many years of contemplation of series.
Generally speaking a series consists of a group of records which are consecutively
arranged and have a common format. A chronological group of incoming and
outgoing correspondence would be easily identified as a series.
<p>Frequently, the processor finds that there may be three groups of correspondence,
each having the attributes of a series. The solution, in this situation
is to make them sub-series of a correspondence series. One processing supervisor
once argued that any one manuscript collection had a maximum of seven possible
series; by the judicious use of sub-series the arrangement outline (for
it is frequently presented in outline form) always showed seven or less
series. He called these "super-series."
<p>Another archivist argued that before you dealt with series at all, you
had to consider sub-groups, a hierarchical entity between manuscript (or
archival) groups and series. His definition of sub-groups focused on hierarchical
arrangements outside the records themselves. An office with three functional
responsibilities but one filing cabinet, would find its records organized
to follow the functional responsibilities. Although this frequently required
a measure of re-arrangement that is foreign to most archivist's sense of
the proprieties, sub-series are an eminently useful idea. Some records
do, upon examination, prove to have been divided by their creator into
groups reflecting different functional activities. A scientist, for instance,
may maintain distinctions between records relating to research activities,
grant administration, teaching responsibilities, and professional organizations.
Each of these sub-groups may contain a correspondence series, a financial
records series, etc., but the distinctions were maintained by the creator.
Another scientist may have the same split of functions in her professional
career, but keep only one correspondence file, one financial file, and
one photograph.
<p>It is also useful when contemplating the records of several generations
of one family to assign the separate records of each individual family
member into a separate sub-group. I remember overseeing the processing
of a governor's personal papers. They were donated by the widow of the
governor's son. As a single group they contained both the governor's personal
political files and his business records; a business to which the son inherited.
The records, then, mixed the father's papers, the son's papers, and the
records of the business. Among them were the father's file of letters received
from the son when he was away at school. The son's papers contained the
letters he had received from his father during that period. An unwary processor
might have felt it necessary to remove the father's letters from the son's
papers and place them with the father's papers. And to move the son's letters
from his father's collection back to the son's papers. While this would
reflect the creation of the documents, it violated the original order of
the records themselves.
<p>A good rule of thumb, then, is to divide sub-groups on the basis of
function or activity and series and sub-series on the basis of form, that
is to say, correspondence, invoices, vouchers, photos, etc.
<p>Through all this dividing and organizing, it is easiest to maintain
-- in one's head if not on paper -- a rough outline of the component parts.
This outline should consist of brief statements of the sub-groups, the
series, and sub-series.
<p>At the box or folder level, things are generally arranged on a less
philosophic plane and a more physical one. Each box should be filled but
not so full that folders can not be removed and returned. There is little
point in trying to make sure that each series ends at the end of a box.
It is sometimes useful to adjust box fullness so that is the case, but
it shouldn't be a reason to leave a box half-empty.
<p>Folders, by the same token, should not bulge full of paper. Most archival
boxes and folders are of accidental materials yet both can only hold so
much. Generally, folders have score lines on the bottom which allows each
to be given a flat floor for holding groups of records. It is usually easy
to see how to match the fold with the folder's contents. It is sometimes
useful to reduce the number of folders (and the number of descriptive entries)
by combining adjacent folders to make up one with enough paper in it. The
file may have separate folders for As, Bs and Cs; but if each of those
three folders has only one or two pieces of paper, it is reasonable to
combine them into one A-C folder.
<p>Most offices and quite a few individuals find it most useful to file
incoming new materials into the front of the folder; this leads to a reverse
chronological order. It is easiest to claim this as the original order
and to leave it alone rather than attempt to refile the contents into a
more normal chronological order. This is theoretically best and practically
best, as well; for it reduces the amount of time spent processing.
<p>It is clear that the arrangement of the records proceeds in a non-linear
fashion. It is not purely a matter of taking each box as it comes off the
shelf and proclaiming that to be the original order. An analysis of the
overlying structure of the records is necessary, followed by an outline
-- or series list -- presenting that structure. Only then can the individual
boxes and folders be physically moved to fit the new structure. Once that
is established, and everything has been moved, it is best to number --
if only lightly in pencil -- all the boxes in straight sequence and all
the folders from one to the end. Some advise starting anew with folder
number one with each box but I would recommend one numerical sequence for
all.
<p>The big question about arrangement, of course, is how to resolve the
question of the "best" arrangement in the face of conflicting demands of
Provenance, original order, researcher convenience, and administrative
management. In many cases, it is refined even further, is the processor
restoring the original order or creating an entire new one?
<p>Keeping in mind the hazards of presenting a particular order, however
modified, as the "original order," how do you decide to start fresh with
a new order and how much of the old order can you keep? The simplest answer
is that you keep the original order only as long as it is useful; when
it is so fragmented or so bizarre as to impede research and access, then
the processor can legitimately decide to discard it. That is not a choice
to be made lightly, however.
<p><a name="Order!"></a><a href="sidebars.htm#order">Order! Order! Order!</a>
<p>The urge to tidy-up the original order -- "to make it more useful" --
is very strong; and should be resisted to some extent. It is a most serious
decision to monkey with evidence in the expectation that things are being
improved. That is not to say that it is not done, and can not be justified.
Earlier, I mentioned combining the contents of thin folders into fatter
folders when the sequence is straightforward. That is, to some eyes, at
least, tampering with the documentary evidence.
<p>It is difficult to lay out for you instances of reordering that goes
beyond what is necessary; each collection is unique and quite different.
Each must be evaluated on its own terms. I find it easier to instruct processors
to "listen" to the papers, to be watchful for the subtle clues of organization
and order that are frequently scattered among the paper. File-marks, for
instance, are common among records of organizations. These are instructions
from the recipient of the letter or document to the clerk who will be doing
the filing. They may be subjects written in the corner or names underlined
in the document; in either case they are clues to the original filing order.
It is also helpful to have a sense of commercial filing methods of different
time periods. The alphabetical, chronological, or decimal file each enjoyed
their hey-day at different, and frequently recurring, times. Awareness
of filing systems is also helpful; letterboxes, accordion files, file cabinets,
hanging files: all tend towards slightly different kinds of original order.
In other cases, knowledge of the function of the office provides powerful
clues as to the probable filing system. Personnel offices frequently file
by names; lawyers tend to file by cases; and real estate offices might
file by location. Numerical systems almost always require an index or key,
which should be looked for.
<p>Of course, when you have a small group of miscellaneous manuscripts,
the original order is usually not significant. But a jumble of five items
is a lot easier to deal with than a jumble of five thousand items. Even
in the larger group, however, the order of series and sub-series is seldom
a matter of significance. In an office environment, different series are
usually quite definitely located in different physical locations. It is
only when the archival processor is arranging them on the shelf that questions
of the order of the series in the whole group becomes important.
<p>The rule of thumb for these situations is to order the series in sequence
by importance to the office or to the researcher. This almost always means
that the correspondence series is placed first for experience has shown
that both the office of origin and the researcher rely on correspondence
more than any other group as a base for judgments. As a result, financial
records, with their odd-sized ledgers and non-standard sized reports can
be placed at the end of the group where they can be most easily shelved.
<p>Once it has been determined that the original order is lacking or is
incomplete, what are the choices for re-ordering? These are basically three:
chronological, alphabetical, and subject. A chronological order places
everything in a series in chronological order; January before February,
1899 before 1900, and so on. Since we live instant by instant in a chronological
sequence, as the future passes through the present on its way to becoming
the past, this order is generally quite useful. Two objections can be raised,
however.
<p>The first is, in dealing with correspondence, to determine the filing
date. Some offices stamp each incoming item with a date-stamp to mark the
actual date of receipt, but most individuals don't bother. If they toss
their incoming correspondence in a file folder as they come in, however,
a sequence by receipt is automatically established. To create a chronological
order where none existed is to frequently rely on the date of writing and
not the date of receipt. (It should be clear that to the writer, the date
of writing is the most significant date, but to the recipient, the date
it is read is most significant.) However, these distinctions are only useful
to a very small group of scholars and, as a result, except in very special
cases such as a literary correspondence, are ignored. It is quicker to
group materials by month (or in smallish files, by year) and leave the
order within each folder entirely random.
<p>It used to be recommended that the manuscripts processor carefully pencil
the date in the upper right-hand corner of the letter surrounded by brackets
in the English fashion: [1 March 1905]. If the month was known but not
the date, then just March 1905 was recorded; and if just the year and no
month or date, then [1905] was all that was necessary. This makes it easy
to sort and file the documents: items with no date were filed first, followed
by the earliest year, then the earliest month, then the earliest day. This
would establish an order as follows:
<blockquote>[n.d.] i.e., no date
<br>[1904]
<br>[1905]
<br>[3 January 1905]
<br>[29 February 1905]
<br>[March 1905]
<br>[6 March 1905]
<br>[1906]</blockquote>

<p>The assumption that these are in chronological order is then complete;
however, it is an illusion and a fabrication. Particularly, if some of
those dates are annotated with question marks to indicate that the dating
is by guesswork or other analysis. Items with no date, for instance, are
placed first so that the researcher will read them first in the sequence
and can then evaluate them in the context of reading the others in their
dated sequence. This is a useful theory, but the fact is, that they are
not necessarily in any actual chronological sequence. They are in a contrived
sequence that attempts to be chronological. Its success at that can usually
not be measured.
<p>The second objection to a chronological order arises from those who
approach a group of records knowing names but not dates. If they are seeking
all the letters of Senator Foghorn but don't know when he might have written,
they are then forced to skim all the letters in the off-chance that the
Senator was a correspondent. In a small file, this is not much of a burden;
but in a large series, it can be quite onerous. The answer is to develop
a name index to the chronology (which moves you into questions of description)
or to order the material by name or subject.
<p>An alphabetical sequence by name is another common filing system; most
persons are familiar with the twenty-six letter codes and can figure out
that "BEAT" will be filed before "BEET." The advantage of this system is
that it brings all the letters by one individual together in one place;
Senator Foghorn's correspondence will be among the F's. For the processor,
there are a number of traps to this sequence which should be watched for.
The first is determining when a letter is from an individual and when it
is from an office; a shipbuilding firm would most likely deal with a succession
of naval procurement officers and that sequence is best illustrated by
placing the letters under "N" for Navy rather than scattering them throughout
the alphabet under the names of the individual officers. The relationship
to the originator or organizer of the records should be considered paramount.
<p>The second trap to watch for is the mixture of personal and professional
correspondence: the professional materials have last names by which materials
can be filed. The personal letters frequently are so informal as to deny
the processor the key term required to file the letter in the correct position.
<p>The third trap, of course, is that an alphabetical sequence destroys
the chronological order. A researcher interested in documenting the time
sequence represented by the documents will have a much harder time of it.
<p>A subject based file, common to many existing systems, creates little
pockets of information focused on specific tasks or activities. To a processor
establishing such a file from scratch, however, the arbitrariness of defining
subjects and deciding that some items are about this subject and not that
subject can lead, if not to a paralysis of the decision making ability,
to a flippant catch-as-catch-can attitude.
<p>One observer noted a commercial practice which combined the alphabetical
and chronological approaches in such a way as to provide the best of both.
It was noted that files in which the incoming correspondence are filed
by name and the outgoing correspondence by date are cross-indexed. If you
know the date, you can look up the correspondents; if you know the name,
you can look up the dates of other letters. Some read in this a call to
reorganize already ordered files in this fashion; this assumption was later
denied by the original author.
<p>As indicated above, many of the problems of arrangement -- one item
can only be located in one physical place -- can be resolved, to a certain
extent by enhanced descriptive practices; the use of indexes are a particular
example. These will be more closely examined in the next section; however
it should be recognized that arrangement is the key to access and description
should above all enhance the arrangement.
<p>Archivists should be aware that they are only one-half of the access
equation; the researcher -- who frequently approaches the papers from a
completely unanticipated direction -- is the other half. It has, over the
past half century, become clear that arranging materials to suit the anticipated
needs of the researcher is not possible and is counter-indicated by the
researcher's need to stay as close as possible to the original order. What
has not been realized is that the access equation means that time and money
spent by the processor to ease the researcher's burden diminishes the researcher's
expenditure of time and money. Put another way, an unprocessed body of
paper (besides being unprofessional) would mean zero expenditure by the
archivist and 100% expenditure by the researcher. A calendar or item-by-item
list by the processor may require a 90% expenditure by the archives but
only 10% by the researcher -- actually, by all researchers, each individual
researcher would have only a small expenditure of that 10%. Accordingly,
the processor needs to weigh the amount of effort devoted to a body of
records with the assumption of part of the responsibility for access by
the researcher. The lesser expenditure by the archives naturally means
a greater expenditure by all the researchers. Of course, the increased
burden on each individual researcher would be slight as the burden would
be spread, to some extent, among all who use the records.
<p>I had once maintained, after several years of seemingly concentrating
on collections once considered processed, that processing, like history
writing, needed to be redone once each generation. The shift in how we
analyze, arrange and describe collections seemed to be so great that I
assumed that another twenty-five years would bring similar improvements.
A shift has taken place, but in cataloging, not processing. The earlier
change, as noted by Richard C. Berner, from "library" practice to "archival"
practice is now going in the opposite direction in cataloging. The current
approach for processing, as stated by Helen Samuels in the MIT Processing
Manual, is to assume that it will never be done again; this is the processor's
first and last chance to do it right. This denies the folk-saying, as true
about archives as libraries, that "libraries never have enough money to
do it right the first time, but they always can find money to do it over."
<h3>
<a name="practical"></a>Processing practicalities</h3>
<p>Once we get past all the major decisions, what is processing really about?
Like the work of commercial airline pilots, it is 90% tedium and 10% excitement.
Fortunately, the exciting parts are seldom life-threatening. However, it
is difficult to maintain a sharp critical eye out, watching for clues,
when one is counting pages, removing paper clips, or refoldering letters.
In a large collection it is impossible for the processor to read every
piece of paper, but it is not impossible to scan quickly through great
quantities of paper while keeping an eye open for the exceptional and the
extraordinary. It is clearly not a job for a drudge, even if parts of it
are drudge-like in tediousness.
<p>Every processor should have a separate work area consisting of a secretarial-quality
chair (this seldom happens, processors usually get the dregs from the surplus
furniture room); a large work-table, 6x3 feet is probably as small as can
be used; lots of light; adjacent shelving; convenient supplies of acid-free
boxes and folders; and a supply of pencils and notepads, typewriters or
computers. (Even if the computers are stand-alone units with only word-processing
software and a printer, they are worth the investment. The ability to revise
text quickly and without the pain of retyping makes the recent generations
of personal computers ideal for text-dependent activities like container
lists and inventories.)
<p>Also useful to the processor are a handy reference collection to verify
names, dates, positions, and assignments. Barring access to a full library,
this should consist, at the very least, of a dictionary, a thesaurus, a
large biographical dictionary, any local biographical dictionaries or Who's
Who, an institutional telephone book (useful for determining lines of authority
and responsibility), as well as federal and state organizational manuals.
In addition, each archives frequently maintains its own biographical data
file in its area of concern: a university archive, for instance, will find
it useful to prepare an index of faculty members.
<p>Faced with a large backlog, or a constantly arriving succession of new
record groups, the processor might be forgiven for processing only those
groups which seem in some way interesting. This might be a viable procedure
but it is not very systematic. A good system is to have proper accessioning
procedures record each group as it comes in (see the SAA Fundamentals of
Accessioning). At that time, it is possible to flag particular groups as
high priority so that they will be processed more quickly than others.
otherwise, it makes good sense to process things in FIFO order: First In,
First Out. In other words, the older unprocessed materials have a higher
priority than newly received items.
<p>This is useful as a general rule, but there should be the flexibility
to respond to more immediate pressures (oftentimes of a political nature)
to process some more recent collections earlier than others. Contrariwise,
it is sometimes worthwhile to hold off processing a collection until later
than its normal turn; the usual case is where additional materials are
expected to be added to the initial accession.
<p>Nevertheless, whether strictly followed as a linear succession, it is
important that the processor know what things need to be processed and
in what order. Moving some groups ahead and some groups back for particular
reasons do not change the general thrust of the sequence: the longer it
has been in storage, the higher priority it is to be processed.
<p>The difference between processing records one hundred or two hundred
years old and processing records which are only twenty-five years old is
that with the more recent records the potential for ethical conflicts increases.
I have had, at different times, processors uncover a brother's application
to West Point, a former husband's corporate personnel records, and a photograph
of the processor as a student. These and other less dramatic circumstances
reinforce the notion that all processors must keep in mind: records are
created by people for people. In addition, they may be documentation of
human frailties as well as human triumphs. Leaving aside the strictures
of law and custom, particularly those of the Buckley Amendment of 1977
which extended a particular privacy right to student records, archival
processors are frequently faced with ethical questions.
<p>Training of processors should emphasize the essential right to privacy
which all donors would expect. Neither the donor nor the repository will
benefit by the spreading of juicy stories gleaned from a particular collection.
In an archival situation, the strictures are more substantial; the records
are official records and the restrictions imposed on them in the office
of origin must be imposed on them in the archives unless released for specific
purposes. Those purposes seldom include the idle gossip of clerks.
<p><a name="Countways"></a><a href="sidebars.htm#count">Let me count the
ways.</a>
<p>Privacy and confidentiality are then the major issues of an ethical
nature. Processors should be instructed to not take their work home with
them; the funny stories and great letters are to remain known only at the
workplace.
<p>Other ethical issues which should be covered include concealment of
materials through misplaced idealism (let's not mention theft, in this
context); the identification of living individuals who may be known to
the processors; and the manipulation of the arrangement or description
to present or conceal a specific fact. To turn the latter around, I once
humorously suggested that, contrary to normal practice, we retain the canceled
checks of a former governor to forestall any allegations of misconduct.
<p>Any large project is best handled by breaking it into smaller portions
and dealing with them one at a time. A large collection is processed in
the same way: it is divided into series and sub-series, then each box or
folder is processed individually. After a bit, the entire operation becomes
quite natural and regular.
<p>Irregular collections also exist; these are usually smaller, one or
two cubic feet or so. For some reason a small collection can have twice
as many different parts as a large collection. (And I speak here of manuscript
collections, not archival groups.) There might be a batch of letters, a
group of photos, a scrapbook or two, a mess of clippings, some old textbooks,
a few income-tax returns, and some other miscellaneous papers. To treat
these in the same highly organized fashion as a large collection is both
a waste a time and a misuse of resources for the research value is not
only slight but can easily be determined by a quick glance through the
box. Accordingly, it is not necessary to spend a great deal of time on
its arrangement (or, for that matter, on its subsequent description). The
arrangement should be self-evident to anyone who opens the box and looks
and looks at the contents. The important tasks for the processor is to
weed out the purely unnecessary material and ensure that those who would
find this material relevant have an opportunity to open the lid and look
inside. A folder by folder inventory, plus a series description, and biography
are, in effect, gilding the lily.
<h3>
<a name="Costing it"></a>Costing it out</h3>
<p>Like everything else in this world, processing manuscripts and archival
groups costs money. In many archives, however, the cost is hidden in one
or more of a variety of ways in much the same way the building costs --
the rent -- is hidden. When an archival or manuscript repository has budget,
and very few do, the costs are usually divided as follows: salaries and
wages, supplies, equipment, and travel. Benefits to salaries (frequently
as high as 25% of those salaries) is seldom counted as part of the cost
of doing business.
<p>Overhead -- heat, light, telephone, etc. -- are seldom charged to an
archival budget. Accordingly, the costs of processing are disguised because
they are a part of salaries, a part of supplies, a part of equipment, a
part of travel; but the size of that part is frequently unknown.
<p>These are all real costs, however, for it takes staff (i.e., salaries
and wages), equipment (shelves and hand trucks and computers), supplies
(boxes and folders, paper and pencils), as well as heat, lights and telephones,
to make any primary source material available for research. Since these
costs are hidden, is it worthwhile to try to split them out and determine
how much it is actually costing?
<p>Generally speaking, it is probably not that useful to calculate precise
costs of processing. The only point in doing any statistical counting is
if the information will be used to evaluate and take action on some problem.
(Note, however, that having baseline figures from some "normal" time is
useful in determining if a problem actually exists.) If nothing can be
changed as a result of collecting and presenting data, then it is not worthwhile
to collect it in the first place.
<p>There are two situations where it is useful to calculate the cost of
processing. The first is in preparing a grant application where correctly
working out the initial budget may mean completing the project with grant
funds or having to finish it off on institutional funds. In addition, grant
reviewers are increasingly considering the effectiveness and efficiency
of the grant dollar and are unlikely to authorize an award if the costs
for processing seem too high.
<p>The second situation where costing out the processing is useful is in
internal management of the processing activities. This is not so much a
matter of calculating dollar costs as figuring processing time. For instance,
if a collection needs to be completely processed in time for the exhibit
staff to ransack it for a specific, prescheduled display, can you certify
that it will or will not be done by that date? Although time is truly money
(especially when considering processing costs) it is true that different
institutions with differing staffing patterns would have completely different
costs. However, the time involved for a routine processing job should be
about the same.
<p>For comparison purposes, then, it is more convenient to establish ratios
of time per cubic (or linear) foot. Analyses from a number of institutions
over the past decade have demonstrated that, on the average, an experienced
archival or manuscript processor can arrange and describe about one foot
every 25 hours. A full-time processor can do nearly two feet a week at
that rate. Accordingly, if the collection is 100 cubic feet, then it should
be completed in 250 hours, give or take a few. (See Abraham, Terry, Stephen
E. Balzarini, and Anne Frantilla. What is backlog is prologue: a measurement
of archival processing. <i>American Archivist</i> 48:1(Winter 1985)31-44.
for more numbers and bibliography.)
<p>A quick analysis of any one year's processing data -- assuming that
data has been collected -- would supply numbers which would adjust that
25 hours to fit institutional requirements. If your institution, for one
reason or another, averages 30 hours per foot, then use that figure in
your planning calculations.
<p>No matter which number (and the variables affecting it are considerable)
is used, once determined it provides a planning tool to compare processing
rates with accession rates; to evaluate the staffing of processing in comparison
with reference or some other activity; and to internally (i.e., within
the archival establishment) manage resources to get the necessary job done.
And, if a specific dollar per hour figure can be attached to the processor's
work, it makes possible questions such as: "Is this collection worth the
nearly $9000 in staffing alone it will cost us to process it?" On top of
that, of course, one must add the cost of supplies and materials, the percentage
of overhead costs, and the frequency and quality of research activity in
that area.
<p>Those who weigh dollars instead of cultural values are prized more in
the business world than in the rarefied atmosphere of historical research;
but when one is approaching the business world for support (as one must
do when institutional and governmental funds are diminishing) it is appropriate
to keep in mind both the cultural and dollar values of any archival activity.
<h3>
<a name="preservation"></a>Basic Preservation</h3>
<p>Going through the actual processes of physical arrangement, foldering and
boxing, is the ideal opportunity to take those actions which, although
slight, will provide some measure of long term preservation. (For more
information on archival conservation, see Ritzenthaler's basic handbook.)
Following a close second after providing the proper temperature and humidity
controls in the archival storage area, using acid neutral storage materials
is the next best thing that can be done. By placing materials in boxes
and folders constructed of acid-neutral paper or cardboard, the archivist
removes one of the major hazards to an archival group. Acid migration is
the term for the ability of acidic papers to contaminate those non-acidic
papers adjacent to them. In addition to self-destruction, an acidic folder,
for instance, can eventually destroy all of its own contents.
<p>This does not, of course, deal with the problem of textual materials
written on acidic papers. Newspaper clippings, telegrams, carbon copies,
and other less than good papers also have a deleterious effect on their
neighbors. Some archives make it a policy to photocopy important clippings
or other low-quality paper but high-quality content items onto acid-neutral
paper. This is quite an expensive option. One solution (although temporary,
it is good for some decades) is to isolate a bundle of clippings from the
adjacent correspondence by placing it in a separate acid-neutral envelope
or folder. Eventually, of course, the clippings will be gone; but in the
meantime, they will be available for the interested researcher without
spreading their destruction to the other materials in the group.
<p>It should be recognized, however, that in all likelihood, few of the
other papers in any group of papers created during the past century is
free from its own internal combustion engine. Most papers for letters,
memos, notes, and records are in themselves acidic to some degree. Some
will last longer than others and most will last longer than newsprint,
but the hazard exists nonetheless. Solutions to this problem are not arrived
at through archival processing. However, an awareness should exist of the
importance of careful arrangement prior to any planned reproduction (such
as microfilming) which will fix its order for all time in a format that
is not the same as that presented by the papers themselves.
<p>Although not strictly a preservation activity, the elimination of duplicate
and extraneous material is an essential part of the processor's activities.
Duplicates usually consist of multiple copies of publications which were
never distributed. It is important to watch for duplication of whole files
which once served a purpose now long gone. These are more common in office
files. In personal papers, there is usually more extraneous material than
duplication. These consist of books, pamphlets, and other printed items
received as part of the donor's papers but which have no evidential value
related to the donor. They should be disposed of by transfer to an appropriate
library. Another common extraneous item are the envelopes from correspondence.
In only a very few cases can the envelopes be justifiably retained as evidence.
In general, it is best to dispose of them. Note, however, that envelopes
with stamps have some value in and of themselves. They should be saved
and disposed of through sale or trade to a stamp club or dealer; the money
can be used to buy more preservation supplies. And, some stamp collectors
purchase manuscript collections for the stamps and would be interested
in learning that the old letters might be of use to somebody else.
<p>Fasteners play a major role in any filing system: paper clips, slide-fasteners,
staples, rubber-bands, and a host of others. A good general rule for the
processor is to remove all fasteners. Paper clips, staples, and other metal
fasteners should be removed because in any contest between the metal fastener
and the paper, the paper will lose and will suffer accordingly. Old-fashioned
straight pins are commonly seen in older files; these are hazardous to
both the papers and the readers. A common problem with staples and papers
clips is rust which bonds them to the paper and makes them very difficult
to remove. A pair of side-cutting wire cutters are quite useful in these
situations. For unrusted staples, the best remover is the plastic handled
squeeze type that forces the staple open with the least damage to the paper.
The slim, wedge-shaped removers, whether affixed to a stapler or not, I
once considered the best design for removing staples because it had no
moving parts and the wedging action operated on the prongs of the staple
in a smooth fashion. Over time, I've realized that, while a classic design,
it is more harmful to the papers than the squeeze-type of staple puller
because all of the force of the wedge forcing between the tangs of the
staple are carried by the paper itself. The squeeze-type, on the other
hand, wedges from both sides of the staple and the force is not fully directed
at the paper. In either case, it is best to use the staple remover on the
under-side of the staple; pop the staple's tangs upright and then carefully
pull the staple out from the other side by hand. If the staple remover
approaches from the top, the effort tends to pull the partially opened
staple through the paper tearing the paper at the holes.
<p><a name="Clip"></a><a href="sidebars.htm#clip">I've never seen that
one before.</a>
<p>In some archival institutions, the stapled connection between two pieces
of paper is considered to be so important an evidential fact that steel
staples and clips are, because of the hazards of rust, replaced by non-rusting
brass staples. The stapler ingeniously converts a roll of brass wire into
quite small and discreet staples as the handle is pushed down. It is a
marvelous little machine, but the attack on the paper is the same. Others
use non-rusting plastic paper clips to serve the same purpose but for long-term
storage and use, these can be faulted for much the same reasons as the
steel clips; they abrade, deform and tear the paper. It is probably best
(not to mention easier, quicker, cheaper, and more efficient) to let the
adjacency of the paper demonstrate their relationship; that is, after all,
the notion behind the whole of the Rule of Original Order.
<p>Rubber bands, over time, lose their resiliency and exude harmful oils
and should be removed. Adhesive tapes should be removed but the process
requires chemicals and the fine hand of the conservator and should not
be attempted unless one has the knowledge and equipment and the materials
deserve that kind of expensive attention.
<p>Removing staples and placing materials in acid-neutral folders are very
simple tasks that should be a routine part of every processing activity.
The long-term benefits are substantial, but it should not be assumed that
this constitutes an effective preservation program. It is merely the least
one can do.
<h3>
<a name="environ"></a>Environmental Impact</h3>
<p>After dealing with the efforts to preserve the archives, it is important
to speak to efforts to preserve the archivist. The environmental hazards
of being an archivist are many but seldom are they given any attention
by the profession. They tend to fall most heavily on the processor, for
the processor is the one who literally lives with a body of records for
weeks or months.
<p>Working conditions for processors tend to be only one step up from the
Black Hole of Calcutta; poorly lit, unpainted concrete walls, industrial
shelving, no windows; its a wonder that people are willing to work under
those circumstances. It is true that some archivists put a brave face on
their work space by putting up posters or funny signs rescued from the
discard pile, but by and large, there is little institutional support for
improving their lot.
<p>And, on top of bunker-like work spaces, processors should be on guard
against a variety of other hazards. Unbraced shelves, for instance. A range
of shelves seven high and forty feet long filled with archival materials
weighs somewhere in the neighborhood of the proverbial sixteen tons. It
is a good idea, when shelves are being installed, to personally inspect
the bracing.
<p>Another hazard given scant attention is weight-lifting. Archival processors
are usually expected to press seventy to a hundred pounds, to snap and
jerk at least fifty. Lifting a standard bank-type transfer box from the
floor to the table is made doubly difficult by both the weight and the
shape. Every archivist should learn to lift boxes safely and with the utmost
care for their own muscular and skeletal limitations. And always use the
leg muscles instead of the back muscles; crouch down instead of bending
over; and call for help before attempting to lift a large box.
<p>Many archives have shifted their boxing patterns to the cubic-foot records
center acid-neutral box which effectively halves the number of boxes but
doubles their weight. The full consequences of this trade-off have yet
to be seen.
<p>Some attention has been paid to the hazards of working with unprocessed
collections. As in your mother's saying, "You don't know where its been."
Archival materials are almost always dusty, but the constituent parts of
that dust have not been analyzed. Archivists with dust allergies of any
sort have to choose between a torment of allergic reactions or a life spent
on decongestants and antihistamines. Industrial or rural storage of papers
may also involve contamination by pesticides or insecticides. While toxicity
levels have probably been reduced by the passage of time, evidence of bugs,
birds and mice among old papers are common enough that processors should
be aware that others may have noted similar signs and attempted some chemical
solution. Another common problem is mold. Damp papers in warm environments
are perfect breeding grounds for mold spores. Most are not aware that even
when the paper has dried and the mold has been brushed off it is merely
hibernating. With the right conditions it will become active again. Even
dried, however, mold spores are frequently an allergen and can cause reactions.
<p>There are no real safeguards to these hazards; but they are hazards
which should be kept in mind. Dust can be vacuumed; molds can be fumigated;
animal remains can be removed. It might be prudent to wear dust masks,
rubber gloves, and lab coats when accessioning a new collection and giving
it its first cleaning. All processing facilities should have a sink and
other facilities for washing up.
<h3>
<a name="summary"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>The arrangement of primary source materials is the process of organizing
a body of materials to meet two goals: to maintain the evidential value
of its original creation and to make it possible to find specific materials
as needed. Maintaining the original order, when that is possible, meets
both requirements for the originators of the file had the same need to
find specific items as do all later researchers. Since it is not always
possible to keep the precise order of creation, or even to recreate it
when it has been lost, archivists have devised a number of other schemes
which permit access to the materials.
<p>All of these, including the original order, are hampered by the impossibility
of any filing system (save one overwhelmed with photocopies like some congressional
files) to place any one item in two spots, both of which are appropriate.
Attempts to resolve this difficulty generally involve a reordering of the
material in theory with appropriate reference to the actual, physical order
of the materials. This solution, however, is one which falls under the
rubric of description, and will be treated in the following section.
