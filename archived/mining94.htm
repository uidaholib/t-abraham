Session title: Archival Resources for Mining History: Who Should
Use them, Why, and Where are they
<p>
Accompanied by <a href="#Additional">Additional Mining Records in the University of Idaho Library </a>(1994)
<hr>

<p>
Looking for documentary materials is often like metals mining.
Sometimes it's on the surface, sometimes it's deep in the ground.
You have to know your geology before you set out to do placer
mining or lode mining. I hope to give some practical and theoretical
tools that will help you locate, sort, and mill the ore bodies
found in archives.
<h2>Mining Records at the University of Idaho</h2>

<p>
The largest and most comprehensive collection of mining records
at the University of Idaho is that of the Day Mines Group of Wallace,
Idaho. Donated to the University by Henry M. Day a decade ago,
they originally consisted of about 1600 cubic feet of corporate
and personal records from northern Idaho's lead-silver region
dating from the late 1890s to the 1980s. They included over ninety
corporations or partnerships forming what was at one time the
fifth largest silver producer in the United States.
<p>
The processing of these records, supported by grants from the
National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the U.S.
Department of Education, the University of Idaho, and the Library
Associates began in 1986 and continued through 1992. In the initial
phase of the effort, the project archivist was Richard C. Davis;
later, Michael Tarabulski was the project archivist. The products
of this activity were the appraisal, analysis, and weeding of
the records; organization into record groups along corporate lines;
individual inventories for the larger bodies of materials; a published
guide, &quot;Day to Day: A guide to the Records of the Historic
Day Mines Group in the University of Idaho Library&quot; (1992);
descriptive entries regarding each mining group in the library's
on-line catalog; as well as entries in the Western Library Network
(WLN), a regional bibliographic utility. Access to the material
is available through a number of means. WLN has a CD-ROM product
that supplies bibliographic access to the collections of over
500 northwest libraries. The University of Idaho is a participant
in the CARL system, and our holdings are available as a menu item
on the CARL terminals here in Colorado and in many other institutions
across the country. It is also possible to TELNET directly to
the University of Idaho's computer and enter the bibliographic
catalog (ida.lib.uidaho.edu) or dial in directly with your modem
(208-885-7721). These high-tech devices are the major tools in
use today for locating archival resources in the United States.
Older printed guides are still useful, however, and should not
be overlooked.
<p>
As in most archival information systems, the mining records are
approachable through a tiered (one might almost say sedimentary)
system; starting with abstracts and guides and expanding to box
and folder inventories. &quot;Day to Day,&quot; the printed guide,
provides a specific description for each of the corporate groups.
It includes a brief corporate history and a summary of the major
record series for each.
<p>
The bulk of the guide, and the most innovative part, is entitled
&quot;Mining records as historical sources.&quot; It explicates
the corporate structure of the mining companies as reflected in
their records and illustrates how that information can be used
as a tool to extract data from the archival records. For instance,
the discussion of corporate property insurance records identifies
two major record series, the Policy Register and Appraisements.
Each of these is described in detail. In addition, it notes that
these records are particularly useful because they &quot;give
specific descriptions of the structures, machinery, equipment,
and supplies&quot; of the company.
<p>
As an example of the abstract and descriptive data available on-line,
I have compiled this list of other significant materials relating
to mining in Idaho and the West that can be found in the University
of Idaho Library. This list concentrates specifically on mining
records, and is not therefore comprehensive of all mining-related
materials in the collection. In addition, let me add that it demonstrates,
to certain extent, the broad range of materials that might contain
or be related to mining records.
<p>
Abe Goff's records of the Moscow Queen Mining Company demonstrate
that relevant records may sometimes be found in unlikely places.
A graduate of the University of Idaho, Goff had a distinguished
and high-ranking military career, and served the federal government
as a lawyer and administrator for many years. Among his personal
files were materials related to a small local mining venture.
These would not be apparent to researchers except that it was
specifically brought out in the cataloging record.
<p>
The next level of description, for the larger collections, is
the inventory or collection register. Both Goff's papers and many
of the larger Day properties have substantial inventories describing
in some detail the contents and organization of the material.
The inventory has a standard form and consists of a biography
or corporate history, a summary description of the records, a
list of the series included in the records, and a folder-by-folder
inventory. In almost all cases, the folder entries are the ones
used by the company in maintaining its own files. Here is where
one has to really dig into the ore body. Folder listings can be
extremely precise or very general. As a consequence, archival
research is very much a hands-on activity.
<h2>Meeting Users' Needs</h2>

<p>
Now that we have identified the ore bodies and the appropriate
tools, what additional resources do you need? Here is where we
can begin to apply some theoretical tools. First is the realization
that the researcher in the archives, unlike the miner, is not
looking at raw ore bodies. This material has been refined to a
certain extent. It has not, in most cases, been purified and cast
into ingots for you, but some of the ore has been crushed, milled
and separated. For example, the cost to the granting agencies
and the University of Idaho in processing the 1600 cubic feet
of Day Mines Records was over $175,000.00 not including the continuing
storage costs. That is a lot of refining.
<p>
Contributions are, of course, always welcome. As Sir William Osler
remarked, &quot;Money invested in a library gives much better
returns than mining stock.&quot;
<p>
Second, we have to realize that archival resources contain more
than one kind of source material. And, by extension, more than
one kind of user. These include genealogists, lawyers, engineers,
and scholars.
<p>
For the genealogist, perhaps more than any other group of researcher,
the personnel records found among those of the mining companies
may be the most important body of records. I was once given a
tour of a mining company storage area together with a few local
citizens. What most excited their interest were the payroll ledgers
in which they looked up and found not only the records of their
own work in the mines but also those of their fathers before them.
That these ledgers were organized by chronological period rather
than by name made it difficult, but not impossible, to find a
specific person's name. Among the records in the Day Mines group
are alphabetical personnel records, in addition to the payroll
ledgers, that provide substantial information on individual miners.
The Hercules Mine, for instance, includes 3 c.f. of employment
cards as well as 6 &#189; c.f. of payroll and compensation ledgers.
<p>
Lawyers are another user group whose use of mining records is
increasing. Mining records have always been primary sources for,
and documentation of, litigation. The Day's purchase and restarting
of the moribund Northport Smelter in 1915 led to a number of pollution
claims by local farmers. The largest and perhaps most interesting
effort going on today is that by the Army Corps of Engineers to
identify hazardous waste sites at abandoned or reallocated military
and other installations. Among the surprises to me was the finding
of unexploded bombs in the national forests that were used for
bombardier training during WWII. The Corps of Engineers team of
archivists and historians is literally combing the country's local,
state, and federal archival agencies for clues about these little-known
hazards.
<p>
As an academic repository, we anticipate that most often our users
will be academics, faculty, and students. As such, we focus on
their needs as our primary clientele. Yet, in organizing and processing
material we have to keep a broader perspective in mind. Institutionalized
records will be around for a lot longer than you or I or the most
recent scholarly fad. Anticipating those needs now and in the
future has meant gaining some sense of how records are created,
maintained, and used. Researchers must rely on archivists as miners
rely on geologists.
<p>
It is an archival truism that records creation is a structured
activity. Few offices are so inefficient that they keep no records
and maintain no filing system. We have learned that such an organized
body of records is of use not only to subsequent researchers,
but also that the order of materials provides important clues
to the structure and activities of the organization. Thus the
archival processing activity is to reveal and maintain the original
order of the material. It is of course, less expensive in the
long run to maintain an existing order rather than attempting
to create a new and artificial one based on some pre-conceived
plan.
<p>
For example, in processing the records of the Day Mines group,
we developed a formal appraisal plan in consultation with an advisory
committee of scholars, archivists, and records creators. The intent
of the plan was to give due consideration to primary and secondary
evidential values while considering the value of the information
in relationship to its bulk. With their help, we were able to
reduce the bulk of the records about 67%. In addition, the appraisal
plan guided the organizational process as we established the research
values of the records series. This &quot;assay&quot; operation
is a major component of the analytical material in &quot;Day to
Day,&quot; the guide to the Day Mines Group materials, and may
prove useful to others working with coporate records.
<p>
The mining of mining records, is, like metals mining, a complex
and sometimes pointless activity. But, if &quot;gold is where
you find it,&quot; this is equally true in archives. When I was
in England last fall I found in Oxford a wonderfully perceptive
collection of letters on California in the 1870s. The reason the
letters were in England? Because the author had written them to
her son and daughter-in-law in Liverpool. And, like these letters,
sometimes you find what you weren't looking for. Similarly, in
some parts of the West there are gravel operations that wash out
just enough gold dust to make a significant profit over their
expenses.
<p>
Serendipity aside, finding what you want and using it effectively
requires asking the right questions; of the archives, of the archivists,
and of the documents themselves. And that means, as my colleague
Richard Davis pointed out in his article in the first Mining History
Annual, scholars need to be familiar with archival activities
and purposes. Understanding the process of records creation, storage,
and use is critically important for scholars working with primary
source materials and the place to learn it is in the archival
repository.
<p>
When I originally referred to archival research as similar to
lode mining or placer mining, I exaggerated. In the western tradition
of tall tales and frontier humor I made the task seem far more
difficult than it really is. Archives are really more like Fort
Knox, except that our doors are open and you are welcome to come
in and seek your fortune (metaphorically speaking). <hr>
