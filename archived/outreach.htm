<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Abstract</p>

</b></i></font><p>Establishing an archival presence on the World Wide Web is
an effective and economical form of outreach. Unlike printed materials there
are no production costs and no left over inventory. Unlike lectures there is
no scheduling, no prima donna speaker, no invitations, and no caterers. And
unlike exhibits, there is no physical presence to monitor and protect. In
addition, a web site is available, to those with the equipment, 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, at no additional cost. Plus, it is infinitely and
immediately updatable, upgradable, and enhanceable.</p>

<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Been There, Done that</p>

</b></i></font><p>The traditional means of archival outreach have included
exhibits, special events, lectures, activities, publications, and audiovisual
presentations. (Pederson, Ann E. and Gail Farr Casterline. <i>Archives &amp;
Manuscripts: Public Programs</i>. Chicago, SAA, 1982. pp. 26-38.) In the last
fifteen years or so, we've been increasingly exhorted to be proactive about
getting the word out about archives (as if we weren't doing that before).
Studies of resource allocators have demonstrated that what we hope people know
about us is very different than what they do know about us; the recent Benton
Foundation report is a good example of that disparity. &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.benton.org/Library/Kellogg/buildings.html">http://www.benton.org/Library/Kellogg/buildings.html</a>&gt;</p>

<p>While it easy for some to say archivists don't do enough outreach, it is,
for the archivist, a matter of measuring priorities and responses. When I
program a lecture or a reception and ten or twelve people show up, I have to
wonder whether my time was well spent. Some years back I devised a scheme to
test the usefulness of two big display cases on the outside wall of Special
Collections facing the heavily used library reserve reading room. I would put
up an exhibit or display but I also included a measurement tool. Placards
suggested that interested viewers visit Special Collections for more
information or prizes were offered for answering simple questions about the
exhibit. At other times I just watched to see who was looking at the cases.
The response was underwhelming.</p>

<p>After a couple of months I decided that the effort of creating these
exhibits, in relation to all other tasks, was not a high priority. And, when
we planned a new building, I purposefully did not include any exhibit
facilities knowing that our staff would probably never get large enough to
make it cost effective.</p>

<p>When I compare such rather meager results with the 35 hits per day on the
Special Collections Web site (approximately 7500 viewers since last June), I
begin to see a way to work smarter not harder.</p>

<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>A Web Site for Special Collections</p>

</b></i></font><p>In 1994, the computing center on campus made it possible to
establish a gopher or web site on their server. I had my doubts about the
gopher server, it seemed that files need to be converted and sent to a
technician who would mount them on the server. An arcane process, one I did
not want to learn, and one that they were not encouraging me to learn. But the
html protocol was something different. They were quick to encourage people and
emphasized how easy it was to set up a web site. </p>




<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Finding Web Content in the Archives</p>

</b></i></font><p>When I began to think about what I wanted to put out on the
Web to represent our repository, I immediately thought of the brochures,
handouts, guides, and inventories that we currently distributed. Almost all
were in word processing form and were, therefore, available for digital
manipulation. I am a strong believer in retaining electronic files for later
use and reuse. I also mine the old files for paragraphs and phrases when
necessary. This work is aided by the search function in my word processor
software. The basic description of the collection exists as a handout that we
had originally duplicated by photocopying on colored paper. &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Primary.Sources.html">http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Primary.Sources.html</a>&gt;</p>

<p>If we had started from scratch, I would have devoted a lot of time to
considering the "best" way to present things on the web. Is a hierarchical
subject approach easier to use? Can we help the user navigate by developing a
"geographical" model; organizing things by location, as some Internet shopping
malls have attempted. Do we need a virtual reference desk, reading room, stack
area, or conservation department to aid the user in getting around the text
that we provide for their assistance? These are valid design questions, but
ones that I skipped. I took what I had and threw it into a conversion and
posted it for all to see. Organizational refinements will come later. And
besides, at the University of Idaho, things are on a different scale than they
are at, say, the National Archives.</p>

<p>But how to convert it to html (Hyper-Text Markup Language)? When I started
this project, the tools available were very primitive and so I learned html
the hard way. Now, I use an html converter that is an add-on to the word
processor. It applies the correct codes and eases the process of converting
the documents, in part through macros I have written. Because of its
limitations, however, I do have to hand-code parts of the document myself. It
is not capable of understanding the nearly obsolete
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt; sequence, for example. I also use an html editor
that I downloaded from the web, it simplifies the coding and viewing of the
page. </p>

<p>The traditional way of learning html was to view the source code of a good
page and learn from it. However, one commentator noted that this method should
be called "defect replication." (Glen Blankenship &lt;glenb@pobox.com&gt;,
"Re: #### Somebody...teach me HTML please!!!!!! ",
&lt;comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html&gt;, Sat, 20 Jul 1996 12:14:22) For
more functional guidance, Sun Microsystems, Inc. has prepared an excellent
guide, with additional links, to Web style at &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.sun.com/styleguide/">http://www.sun.com/styleguide/</a>&gt;.</p>

<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Incremental Add-ons</p>

</b></i></font><p>My intent in recoding existing text for the web was to do it
simply and quickly. Accordingly, I have not bothered about stylistic niceties
that I would worry over if the document was going to become enshrined in print
for all time. These are provisional documents, in a sense. I can revise them
and refine them continuously, but my purpose right now is to get them out
there where they can be, even if haltingly, used. For an example, see &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg189.htm">http://www.lib.uidaho.edu:80/special-collections/Manuscripts/mg189.htm</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>I converted nearly 250 inventories and loaded them onto the web and am now
in the process of tackling the OCR (optical character recognition) conversion
of the 100 or so that were created before word-processors. This is in response
to studies which indicate that researchers most want access to finding aids
and descriptions. (See, for example, Daniel German's
&lt;dgerman@archives.ca&gt; comments "re: Archives and the Net" to Robert
Shuster &lt;rshuster@DAVID.WHEATON.EDU&gt; as posted in an email summary on
Thu, 25 Apr 1996 10:21:48.) </p>

<p>I want to stress that I do not claim that the pages developed at the
University of Idaho fulfill any or all of the goals usually identified for
archival sites. My intent was to get stuff up quickly and inexpensively,
without any extra expense except my own time. And my time has been very much
occupied with this task over the past two and a half years. It was only last
summer that I was able to go back and add some refinements and correct some
errors in the first group of pages loaded; addressing, in the process, some of
the criticisms raised by Bill Landis' article (Landis, William. "Archival
outreach on the World Wide Web," <i>Archival Issues</i>, 20:2(1995)135). In
the meantime, however, we had a web presence. There is no point, I reasoned,
in waiting until everything is perfect; since perfection is never realized.

<p>Let's look at what we've put together at the UofI. &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/">http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/</a>&gt;.</p><dir>

</font><b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Web Sites and Web Sights</p>

</b></i></font><p>Bruce Bruemmer in his recent survey of archival web sites
found less than half included traditional archival information such as
collection descriptions and inventories. He added: "Still, the survey's
results are clear: the Web, at this point in time, is predominantly used to
convey information about repositories, not information held by the
repositories." (Bruce H. Bruemmer, Archivist, Charles Babbage Institute, "An
Analysis of World-Wide Web Sites For Archival Repositories" April 1997. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.cbi.umn.edu/bruce/arcweb.htm">http://www.cbi.umn.edu/bruce/arcweb.htm</a>)
Both, I would claim, are important to users.</p>

<p>As long ago as February 1995 Frank D. Jackson of Emory posted to the
Archives &amp; Archivists list a summary of archival use of the World Wide
Web. (Frank D. Jackson &lt;fjack01@EMORY.EDU&gt;, "Internet Gems," Archives
&amp; Archivists &lt;ARCHIVES@MIAMIU.BITNET&gt;, Fri, 3 Feb 1995 10:11:45; see
also William Landis, "Archival outreach on the World Wide Web," <i>Archival
Issues</i>, 20:2(1995)129-147.) These suggest the range of information that
can be placed on the web:</p>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Contact Information </li>
<li>Exhibition Catalogs </li>
<li>Finding Aids (with keyword searching) </li>
<li>Hours of Operation </li>
<li>Introductions </li>
<li>Lists of Manuscript Collections </li>
<li>Lists of Other Archival Sites </li>
<li>Newsletters (current and past issues) </li>
<li>Oral History Transcripts </li>
<li>Regulations for Use </li>
<li>Scope and Content Notes </li>
<li>University-Wide Records Retention Schedules </li>
<li>Workshop Announcements</li></ul>
</ul>

<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Non-Traditional Outreach on the Web</p>

</b></i></font><p>Aside from the exhibit/interpretive aspect of outreach,
there are a number of other, more non-traditional, outreach activities that
are enhanced by the use of the World Wide Web. </p>

<p>Promotional activities of a traditional nature can be given a boost by
publicizing them through the institutional web page as well as through
institutional and international listservs and newsgroups. Are you sponsoring a
lecture or a fellowship? Publicize it easily on the web and through electronic
announcements.</p>

<p>While reference functions are not often considered outreach, they do
provide an opportunity for one-on-one promotion and dissemination. Don't we
often promote additional services and collections in the course of a reference
interview? The same is true of the e-mail inquiry. Do your e-mail messages
include a signature line that identifies you and your institutional web page?
</p>

<p>Our web pages have generated a small number of e-mail reference requests,
often responding to specific information in an inventory or description.
Others, more blind inquiries, can be referred to the web site for additional
information. For some telephone inquiries I have asked if they have web
access, and referred them to a web page, one of ours or perhaps one of yours.
Letters requesting information can often be answered by referral to the web
page and, if they include an email address, by mailing the page directly to
them. In some cases, I've just run a printout of the page and mailed that,
snail-mail.</p>

<p>One advantage of this reservoir of information about the collections and
holdings is that it allows us to transfer the costs of reproduction off-site.
While we cheerfully copy an inventory for a distant researcher, I'd much
rather refer them to the web page and let them copy it out on their machine at
their cost. And we've had researchers appear on our doorstep with a printout
in hand, ready to go to work.</p>


<p>While the University of Idaho Library is a relatively small organization
and Special Collections smaller still, we have found the internal use of our
web page a significant outreach tool. Not only do other library staffers now
have an opportunity to learn about our collection, but they can and do use the
posted resources to answer questions posed to them. It is just another
electronic resource to them, but one that has the added benefit of referring
to local holdings. To a certain extent, this is true within Special
Collections as well. We now can share our expertise to a greater extent during
a time of required cross training and under-staffing. Relying on the web for
some common answers also means that similar questions get standardized
answers, not answers that are different depending on who is asked. We haven't
quite got to the point of posting our file of common questions and their
uncommon answers, but I have used some of those questions as jumping off
points for our Digital Memories exhibits &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063139/http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/dgtlcurr.html">http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/dgtlcurr.html</a>&gt;.</p>

<b><i><font face="Arial"><p>Conclusions</p>

</b></i></font><p>While I would not suggest that the Web will replace all
other forms of outreach, it more than complements them. Much of what can be
done and has been done can be replicated on the Web, easily and effectively,
as a reinforcement if not the primary activity. And the potential reach of the
web is far beyond what we have previously envisioned for outreach.</p>
